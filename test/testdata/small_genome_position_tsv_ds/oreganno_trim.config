# type must also include information about whether it is genome vs. position for tsv, vcf, and other easy types.
# Supported types:
#	gene_tsv -- Generic gene indexed datasource from a tsv
#	genomic_position_tsv -- Generic genomic position indexed datasource from a tsv
#
#	cosmic -- Custom datasource class for COSMIC
#	dbSNP -- Custom datasource class for dbSNP
#	gaf -- Custom datasource class for GAF

type: gp_tsv

# Required for genomic_position_tsv, MUST chr, start, and end in order.  If not a genomic_position_tsv, then this field is ignored:
genomic_position_cols: hg19.oreganno.chrom,hg19.oreganno.chromStart,hg19.oreganno.chromEnd

# Required for gene_tsv, otherwise ignored:
